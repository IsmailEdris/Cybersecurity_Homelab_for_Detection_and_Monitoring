In this part of the lab, I will be setting up an Active Directory for security monitoring. The AD domain will be set up with a Windows 2019 Server as the Domain Controller and 2 Windows 10 machines. 

## Step 1: Download and configure Windows 2019 Server
In this step, I will be downloading the .iso disc image of the 2019 Windows Server and will be doing basic configuration on it. 

- Downloaded the .iso image from [microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019)
